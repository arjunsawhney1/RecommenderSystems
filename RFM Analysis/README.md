# Recommender Systems: RFM Analysis
In this project, I explore RFM Analysis and its utility in designing personalized recommender systems

## RFM: What is it?
RFM stands for the three dimensions:
- `Recency` – How recently did the customer purchase?
- `Frequency` – How often do they purchase?
- `Monetary Value` – How much do they spend?
The resulting segments can be ordered from most valuable (highest recency, frequency, and monetary value) to least valuable (lowest recency, frequency, and value). Identifying the most valuable RFM segments can help capitalize on a good recommendation

## Data: E-commerce¶
The most common application for RFM analyses is in the e-commerce sector. The following e-commerce data was sourced from Kaggle.

## Recommendation Task
We wish to recommend items to users based on their purchase habits.
